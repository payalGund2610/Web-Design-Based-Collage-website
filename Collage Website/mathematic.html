        <b> History </b>
        <p> Mathematics is a historical subject. It has been explored by various mathematicians across the world since centuries,
            in different civilizations. Archimedes, from the BC century is known to be the Father of Mathematics.
            He introduced formulas to calculate surface area and volume of solids. Whereas, Aryabhatt, born in 476 CE, 
            is known as the Father of Indian Mathematics.
            In the 6th century BC, the study of mathematics began with the Pythagoreans, as a ‚Äúdemonstrative discipline‚Äù.
            The word mathematics originated from the Greek word ‚Äúmathema‚Äù, which means ‚Äúsubject of instruction‚Äù.
            Another mathematician, named Euclid, introduced the axiom, postulates, theorems and proofs,
            which are also used in today‚Äôs mathematics.
            History of Mathematics has been an ancient study and is described by each part of the world, in a varying method.
            There were many mathematicians who have given different theories for many concepts, 
            which we are applying in modern mathematics.
