        <b> History </b>
        <p> Therotical and experimental studies of electricity during the 18th and 19th centuries led to the 
            development of the first electrical machines and the beginning of the widespread use of electricity.
            The history of electronics began to evolve separately from that of electricity late in the 19th century 
            with the identification of the electron by the English physicist Sir Joseph John Thomson and the
             measurement of its electric charge by the American physicist Robert A. Millikan in 1909.
             At the time of Thomsonâ€™s work, the American inventor Thomas A. Edison had observed a bluish glow in
              some of his early lightbulbs under certain conditions and found that a current would flow from one 
              electrode in the lamp to another if the second one (anode) were made positively charged with respect
               to the first (cathode). Work by Thomson and his students and by the English engineer John Ambrose
                Fleming revealed that this so-called Edison effect was the result of the emission of electrons from 
                the cathode, the hot filament in the lamp.
